This is how an exemplary blog article would look like. The first paragraph will be used as a summary on the fronpage and the blog overview. All other content will be contained in the full view of the article.

Our blog articles are intended to highlight currently ongoing research, may include plots, figures, images and are designed to provide insights into the scientific work we do in the project.
